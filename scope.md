# Project Scope Statement — Personal Webpage (Semantic HTML)
**Date:** January 25, 2026  
**Name:** Arnold Archaga

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to plan and build a simple one-page website about me using semantic HTML. The main point is to practice scoping first, so I don’t overthink the website or add stuff that isn’t required. Having a clear scope should make the HTML part quicker and more focused.

## Description
This project has two files:

1) **scope.md** — this document (written in Markdown) that explains what I’m building and what I’m not building.
2) **index.html** — a single-page website about me using semantic HTML.

The website will include my name, what I’m studying, a short description of my goals, a list of hobbies/interests, and a link to my GitHub.

## Desired Results
I’ll consider the project done when:

- `scope.md` clearly explains what the project includes and excludes.
- The plan in `scope.md` matches what’s actually on the webpage.
- `index.html` is a valid HTML page that opens correctly in a browser.
- The page includes all required content:
  - `<title>` in the `<head>`
  - `<h1>` with my name
  - `<h2>` with my major or interests
  - at least **two** paragraphs about my goals
  - a `<ul>` with at least **three** hobbies/interests
  - a link (`<a>`) to my GitHub profile
- The HTML is organized using semantic tags so it’s easy to read:
  - `header` for the top section
  - `main` for the main content
  - `section` to group topics
  - `footer` for the bottom info
- The code is clean and consistently indented.

## Exclusions
To keep this project simple and inside the assignment requirements, I’m not including:

- CSS styling or anything focused on design (default browser look is fine)
- JavaScript or interactive features
- extra pages, menus, or navigation systems
- frameworks/libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind
- images, videos, or other embedded content
- forms or back-end features

Basically, I’m keeping it to a clean, organized HTML page that meets the requirements and matches the scope.
