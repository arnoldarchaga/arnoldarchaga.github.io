        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I already earned my associate degree in Computer Science, and I’m currently working on my bachelor’s degree in
          Computing Applications. I like learning by actually building things because it makes the concepts easier to
          understand and remember.
        </p>
        <p>
          Career-wise, my goal is to become a software developer. I’m trying to improve my skills one project at a time,
          especially writing cleaner code, staying organized, and getting better at planning before I start.
